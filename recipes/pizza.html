            For the sauce for this pizza,
            we recommend preparing our easy Classic Pizza Sauce. With a hint of garlic,
            salt and basil, it's the ideal pizza sauce that will help to bring out the 
            flavours in the other ingredients used here</li>
        <li>Fire up your pizza oven. Aim for 500˚C on the stone baking board inside.</li>
        <li>
            Using a small amount of flour, dust your pizza peel. 
            Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12″/16″ and lay it out on your pizza peel.
            Top with the mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza off the peel and into your pizza oven, making sure to rotate the pizza regularly.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pizza from the oven and top with whole, fresh basil leaves. Serve immediately</li>
